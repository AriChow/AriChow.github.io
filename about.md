<p>Hello, my name is Aritra Chowdhury. I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in the department of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My research adviser is Dr. BÃ¼lent Yener with whom I work at the Data Science Research Centre at RPI. I was awarded M.S. in Computer Science at R.P.I. in May 2016. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India in June 2013.

My research interests lie in application of computer vision in scientific image datasets. I am primarily focussed on understanding the representations of images in feature space. I work with a lot of medical imaging datasets. One of the projects also involved working with images of microstructure in material science. Currently I am trying to formalize a mapping of representations from convolutional neural networks to representations like visual bag of words, texture statistics and cell-graphs.</p>
